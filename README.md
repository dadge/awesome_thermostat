_Component developed by using the amazing development template [blueprint][blueprint]._

This custom component for Home Assistant is an upgrade of my first component "simple thermostat" with addition of trully awesome features.

## Why another thermostat implementation ? 
For my personnal usage, I needed to add a couple of features and also to update the behavior that I implemented in my previous component "Simple thremostat".
This new component "Awesome thermosts" now manage the awesome use cases : 
- Explicitely define the temperature for presets mode in config file.
- Unset the preset mode when the temperature is manually defined on a thermostat.
- Turn off/on a thermostat when a door or windows is opened/closed.
- Set a temperature when an activity is detected in a room, and another one after no activity has been detected for a defined time.
- Choose the algorithm mode to a simple threshold or more sofisticated proportional one (see below).
- Add power management to avoid exceeding a defined total power 

## That's awesome ! How Can I enjoy this awesome thermostat  ?

### HACS installation

1. Install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/). That way you get updates automatically.
2. Add this Github repository as custom repository in HACS settings.
3. search and install "Awesome Thermostat" in HACS and click `install`.
4. Modify your `configuration.yaml` as explain below.
5. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `awesome_thermostat`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/awesome_thermostat/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Modify your `configuration.yaml` as explain below
7. Restart Home Assistant

## Minimum requirements

* This implementstion can override or superseed the core generic thermostat

## Configuration

In the following examples we are assuming that you know how to configure a generic thermostat (if not please have a look at : https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/generic_thermostat/ ) and we will just highlight the differences in the configuration to apply. 


### Minimal configuration update
The minimal configuration for a generic thermostat is the following :  
```yaml
climate:
  - platform: generic_thermostat
    name: Study
    heater: switch.study_heater
    target_sensor: sensor.study_temperature
```
If you want to switch to an awesome thermostat, your new configuration will be : 
```yaml
climate:
  - platform: awesome_thermostat
    name: Study
    heater: switch.study_heater
    target_sensor: sensor.study_temperature
```
Congrats ! You just migrate to an awesome thermostat behaving exactly like the generic one !

### What !? But where are the awesome features? The preset modes for example ? 
Ok, let's start the real fun. Concerning the preset modes, you first have to know that, as defined in the core development documentation (https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/climate/), the preset mode handled are the following : 
 - ECO : Device is running an energy-saving mode
 - AWAY :	Device is in away mode
 - BOOST : Device turn all valve full up
 - COMFORT :	Device is in comfort mode
 - HOME :	Device is in home mode
 - SLEEP :	Device is prepared for sleep
 - ACTIVITY :	Device is reacting to activity (e.g. movement sensors)

As it was implemented in generic thermostat, I extended the management of the temperatures for each mode by configuration with te following keys : eco_temp, away_temp, boost_temp, comfort_temp, home_temp, sleep_temp
An exception was made for activity as for this specific mode we need to set 2 temperatures. Just remember that setting activity_temp won't work.
So imagine that you want to set temperature for each of the classic preset mode, your new configuration file will be : 
```yaml
climate:
  - platform: awesome_thermostat
    name: Study
    heater: switch.study_heater
    target_sensor: sensor.study_temperature
    eco_temp: 18.5
    away_temp: 16
    boost_temp: 23
    comfort_temp: 21.5
    sleep_temp: 20
```
In this example you can see that I didn't set activity_temp BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK for this preset mode. Also I didn't set home_temp because I don't need it.
The result of this configuration is that I created a thermostat on which I can choose the following modes : Eco, Away, Boost, Comfort, Sleep and None.

'None' is always added in the list of modes, as it is a way to not use the presets modes but a manual temperature instead. 
!!! IMPORTANT !!! The contrary of the previous sentence is also true : IF A PRESET MODE IS SET, IT WILL BE CHANGE TO NONE IF YOU MANUALLY CHANGE THE TEMPERATURE.

### Awesome ! And What about the doors/windows turning on/off the thermostats ? 
Good question ! The use case is the following : every morning I open the windows of the rooms to renew the air and of course the thermostat have to be stopped. And when I close the windows, the thermostat must be turned on. As I have sensor on all of my doors and windows, I decided to use them to automatize this action.
The only thing that we need to declare is the windows sensor, with the config key window_sensor : 
```yaml
climate:
  - platform: awesome_thermostat
    name: Study
    heater: switch.study_heater
    target_sensor: sensor.study_temperature
    eco_temp: 18.5
    away_temp: 16
    boost_temp: 23
    comfort_temp: 21.5
    sleep_temp: 20
    window_sensor: binary_sensor.study_windows
```
And that's it ! your thermostat will turn off when the windows is open and be turned back on when it's closed.
Note 1 : this implementation is based on 'normal' door/windows behavior, that's mean it considers it's closed when the state is 'off' and open when the state is 'on'
Note 2 : If you want to use several door/windows sensors to automatize your thermostat, just create a group with the regular behavior (https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/binary_sensor.group/). 

### Configure the activity mode
We will now see how to configure the new Activity mode. For this mode I freely inspired myself from a blueprint shared by @ChrisInUK (https://community.home-assistant.io/t/motion-controlled-room-eco-heating/291322) and I gratefully thank him for his job.
What we need: 
- a motion sensor. The key in configurationfile is "motion_sensor".
- a target "motion" mode. We will used the same temperature than this mode when an activity is detected. The key in configurationfile is "motion_mode".
- a target "no motion" mode. We will used the same temperature than this mode when no activity is detected.  The key in configurationfile is "no_motion_mode".
- a "motion delay" duration defining how many time we leave the temperature like in "motion" mode after the last motion is detected.  The key in configurationfile is "motion_delay".

So imagine we want to have the following behavior :
- we have room with a thermostat set in activity mode, the "motion" mode chosen is comfort (21.5C), the "no motion" mode chosen is Eco (18.5 C) and the motion delay is 5 min. 
- the room is empty for a while (no activity detected), the temperature of this room is 18.5 C
- somebody enters into the room, an activity is detected the temperature is set to 21.5 C
- the person leaves the room, after 5 min the temperature is set back to 18.5 C

The configuration we have to set is the following : 

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: awesome_thermostat
    name: Study
    heater: switch.study_heater
    target_sensor: sensor.study_temperature
    eco_temp: 18.5
    away_temp: 16
    boost_temp: 23
    comfort_temp: 21.5
    sleep_temp: 20
    motion_sensor: input_boolean.study_motion_sensor
    motion_mode: comfort
    no_motion_mode: eco
    motion_delay:
      minutes: 5
```
Be aware that as for the others preset modes, Activity will only be proposed if it's correctly configure. In other words, the 4 configurayion keys have to be set if you want to see Activity in home assistant Interface

### Algorithm 
By default the simple threshold algorithm is used. That mean, if temperature goes beyond or above the target temperature +/- 0.3, then the radiator is started or shutdown. When using this algorithm you will see that the temperature oscillate aroud target temperature but doesn't stabilize.
To use this algorithm you have configure you thermostat like this:

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: awesome_thermostat
    name: Study
    heater: switch.study_heater
    target_sensor: sensor.study_temperature
    eco_temp: 18.5
    away_temp: 16
    boost_temp: 23
    comfort_temp: 21.5
    sleep_temp: 20

    algorithm: Threshold
    cold_tolerance: 0.3
    hot_tolerance: 0.3
```

A Proportional algorithm is also available to avoid this oscillation around the target temperature. This algorithm is based on a cycle which alternate heating and stop heating. The proportion of heating vs not heating is determined by the difference between the temperature and the target temperature. Bigger the difference is and bigger is the proportion of heating inside the cycle.
This algorithm make the temperature converge and stop oscillating.

Depending of your area and heater, the convergente temperature can be under the targeted temperature. So a biais parameter is available to fix this. To find the right value of biais, just set it to 0 (no biais), let the temperature converge and see if it is near the targeted temperature. If not adjust the biais. A good value is 0.25 with my accumulator radiator (which are long to heat but keeps the heat for a long time).

A function parameter is available. Set it to "Linear" to have a linéar growth of temperature or set it to "Atan" to have a more aggressive curve to target temperature depending of your need.

The parameter for this mode are the following:

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: awesome_thermostat
    name: Study
    heater: switch.study_heater
    target_sensor: sensor.study_temperature
    eco_temp: 18.5
    away_temp: 16
    boost_temp: 23
    comfort_temp: 21.5
    sleep_temp: 20

    algorithm: "Proportional"
    prop_bias: 0.25
    prop_function: "Linear"
    prop_cycle_min: 6
```

### Power management
This feature allows you to regulate the power consumption of your radiators. Give a sensor to the current power consumption of your house, a sensor to the max power that should not be exceeded, the power consumption of your radiator and the algorithm will not start a radiator if the max power will be exceeded after radiator starts.
Example configuration:

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: awesome_thermostat
    name: Study
    heater: switch.study_heater
    target_sensor: sensor.study_temperature
    eco_temp: 18.5
    away_temp: 16
    boost_temp: 23
    comfort_temp: 21.5
    sleep_temp: 20

    power_sensor: sensor.total_instant_home_power
    max_power_sensor: input_number.heating_power_max
    device_power: 1.0
```

Note that all power values should have the same units (kWh for example).
This allows you to change the max power along time using a Sceduler or whatever you like.

### Mix all configurations to get an awesome thermostat !
Example of full configuration:

```yaml
- name: Thermostat mezzanine
  platform: awesome_thermostat
  heater: switch.radiateur_mezzanine

  initial_hvac_mode: "off"
  precision: 0.1
  eco_temp: 17
  away_temp: 17
  boost_temp: 20
  comfort_temp: 19
  sleep_temp: 12
  algorithm: "Proportional"
  prop_bias: 0.25
  prop_function: "Atan"

  window_sensor: binary_sensor.window_mezzanine
  power_sensor: sensor.total_instant_home_power
  max_power_sensor: input_number.heating_power_max
  device_power: 1.6
```
Enjoy !

## Even Better with Scheduler Component ! 

In order to enjoy the full power of awesome thermostat, I invite you to use it with https://github.com/nielsfaber/scheduler-component 
Indeed, the scheduler component porpose a management of the climate base on the preset modes. This feature has limited interest with the generic thermostat but it becomes highly powerfull with Awesome thermostat : 

Starting here, I assume you have installed Awesome Thermostat and Scheduler Component.

In Scheduler, add a schedule :

Choose "climate" group, choose one (or multiple) entity/ies, select "MAKE SCHEME" and click next : 
(it is possible to choose "SET PRESET", but I prefer to use "MAKE SCHEME")

Set your mode scheme and save :

In this example I set ECO mode during the night and the day when nobody's at home BOOST in the morning and COMFORT in the evening. 


I hope this example helps you, don't hesitate to give me your feedbacks !
